# MA3_StartShow
My custom grandMa 3 StartShow file.

The modifications I have made to the start show are:

* Compact Position Picker, with Go Button to all move at once. (Updated Position Preset Macro, to Include Low/Mid/High Positions.
* Compact Gobo Picker (same page as Positions), with Go Button for Zoom, Focus, Gobo, Animation and Iris Small.
* Color Picker Presets, Find a Color combination you want and save it to a recallable Preset.
* Advanced Position Phaser Engine! Two Seperate Phaser Faders, you can Select Which Groups you want to have in the Faders with: Phaser Form, Groups, Blocks, Wings, Phase and Selection Shuffle.
* Advanced Color and Dimmer Phaser Engine! Select which groups you want to have in the Phaser Fader with: Form, XGroups, XBlocks, XWings, Phase and Selection Shuffle.

Things Currently on my radar to improve: 

* Part of the Position Preset Macro that asks for your Pan and Tilt Limits (-35 Thru 35 Pan, -10 Thru 100 Tilt Etc.)
* A macro that makes your Base Groups (Linear/Odd/Even).
* A focus macro that does your (Small/Mid/Wide)
